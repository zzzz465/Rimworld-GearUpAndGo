	<description>The original author Uuugggg has sadly passed away. I'll maintain this (or other mods) to keep his mods alive.
Uuugggg already did most of the work for 1.6.

## Original Description

A button to GEAR UP AND GO.
Draft, get gear for the current ouffit, and go to a targeted location.

Will set a policy for the mod Better Pawn Control when the button is clicked. Set the policy name in the Settings.
